## Project Background
Analysis of global life expectancy trends across countries to understand the impact
of economic development (GDP), health factors (BMI), and development status on
life expectancy outcomes between 2007 - 2022.

## Goals and Objectives 
1. Identify countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies.
2. Analyze life expectancy trends over time and by economic status (developing vs.
developed).
3. Explore correlations between GDP, BMI, and life expectancy.
4. Handle data quality issues such as duplicates and missing values to ensure robust
analysis.
