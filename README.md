## Project Background
Analysis of global life expectancy trends across countries to understand the impact
of economic development (GDP), health factors (BMI), and development status on
life expectancy outcomes between 2007 - 2022.

## Goals and Objectives 
1. Identify countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies.
2. Analyze life expectancy trends over time and by economic status (developing vs.
developed).
3. Explore correlations between GDP, BMI, and life expectancy.
4. Handle data quality issues such as duplicates and missing values to ensure robust
analysis.

## Executive Summary
Analysis of worldwide life expectancy data reveals significant disparities between
developed and developing nations, with a strong correlation between GDP and life
outcomes. Key findings:
* 52.7 year gap between highest and lowest life expectancy countries
* Countries with GDP ≥$1,500 show 9.7 years higher life expectancy
* Developed nations average 12.4 years longer life expectancy than developing
ones
* Adult mortality trends show consistent decline in most regions
